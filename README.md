## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Sass/SCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

First time I used SCSS.

### Continued development

I used only one SCSS file and I want to try creating folders and creating a system for later use.

### Useful resources

- [background](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/background/) - This helped me to figure how the shorthand must be used. Sometime still have issues.
